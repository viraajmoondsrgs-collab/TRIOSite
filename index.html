    <p style="text-shadow: 0 0 10px #06c8eb, 0 0 20px #88e90a; text-align: justify;">The Trio Site (this) is just a site that explains (kinda) about trio! <br>
    Its like a software company thing, that we will make in the future. We can't tell what it is because other people will copy us.<br>
    So this is the website state that it will stay in, possibly for a long time.<br><br><br>SIKE!<br>
    What this will be is a website that will show off our products, and maybe have a blog or something. We will see!<br><br><br>
    The products we will make will be some software, but not hardware. This is because the area where we are working on is one that is not tinkered
    around with as much right now, and we think that it has potential. They will be TrioInstaller, which is a software which will help you to manage
    something (the thing is something we can't tell yet or it will reveal everything). Ok fine, there will be some hardware, but it will be a seperate part
    called Bart, which will make, probably something like the thing you are reading this on, but it will be WAYY more powerful. There will also be TrioSound,
    which will be a software that helps you to stream music, and make music! We are planning something innovative for the music making part. Now, many of you
    may be screaming,"BUT YOUR NAME WILL HAVE LEGAL ISSUES!!", and you are right, but we are a step ahead of you and already have a backup name, which we can't tell
    you because then other people will take that name, and then we will have to change again. We also have designed a design language (like Material Design on Android)
    called Fluroscent Design, which is a design language that combines cyberpunk feels, with traditional friendly design (rounded corners etc.). Now, my real Youtube channel is-
    https://www.youtube.com/@viraajmoond6326, and the official Trio channel is-https://www.youtube.com/@TrioOfficial-real, which currently does not have any videos, but we will upload sometime.
    Please Subscribe to both channels. So this is all for now, but we will update this website when we have more news about Trio!<br><br><br></p>
